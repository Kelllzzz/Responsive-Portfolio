      <p>
        The main difficulty with describing how to contribute to a project are the numerous variations on how to do
        that. Because Git is very flexible, people can and do work together in many ways, and it’s problematic to
        describe how you should contribute — every project is a bit different. Some of the variables involved are active
        contributor count, chosen workflow, your commit access, and possibly the external contribution method.
        The first variable is active contributor count — how many users are actively contributing code to this project,
        and how often? In many instances, you’ll have two or three developers with a few commits a day, or possibly less
        for somewhat dormant projects. For larger companies or projects, the number of developers could be in the
        thousands, with hundreds or thousands of commits coming in each day. This is important because with more and
        more developers, you run into more issues with making sure your code applies cleanly or can be easily merged.
        Changes you submit may be rendered obsolete or severely broken by work that is merged in while you were working
        or while your changes were waiting to be approved or applied. How can you keep your code consistently up to date
        and your commits valid?
